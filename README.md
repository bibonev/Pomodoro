I have written a small web application to help me be more concentrated for longer period of time. It is based on the famous pomodoro technique whihch I was thought in my first year at university. 

## Usage

In the application you can see two button and one form. 

## Start/Reset button 

The button have the ability to control the flow of the stopwatch you can set manually by typing the exact minutes and second you would like your pomodoro session to last

## Form

There is a form which is enabled when the stopwatch is not running. Using the form you can actually add tasks. When the stopwathc is running the form is being disabled.

## Tasks

There is a button on the left and a checkbox on the right of the task. With the X you can remove a task you dont find particularly important during the pomodoro session and with the checkbox, you can cross out a task you completed during the pomodoro session.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Notes

### Tools

I have used React to develop the application as I wanted to enhance my skills with this library. I have also used <code>create-react-app</code> in order to create the necessery files for development and in the end I have ejected the module.
